	For renames and copies, make sure that both file names are valid
	* src/patch.c (main): Allow there_is_another_patch() to set the
	skip_rest_of_patch flag.
	* src/pch.c (intuit_diff_type): For renames and copies, also check the "other"
	file name.
	(pch_copy, pch_rename): Now that both names are checked in intuit_diff_type(),
	we know they are defined here.

2015-01-20  Andreas Gruenbacher  <agruen@gnu.org>

	Fail when out of memory in set_hunkmax()
	src/pch.c (another_hunk): Call set_hunkmax() from here to make sure it is
	called even when falling back from plan A to plan B.
	(open_patch_file): No need to call set_hunkmax() anymore.
	src/pch.c (set_hunkmax): Fail when out of memory. Make static.
	src/pch.h: Remove set_hunkmax() prototype.

	Don't try applying hunks at offsets that can't work
	* src/patch.c (locate_hunk): Start trying to apply the hunk at the minimum
	offset which puts the hunk in the valid range of lines. This will often still
	be offset 0.

	Move symlink_target_is_valid() and cwd_is_root()
	* src/util.c: Move symlink_target_is_valid() and cwd_is_root() here from

2015-01-19  Andreas Gruenbacher  <andreas.gruenbacher@gmail.com>

	Make sure symlinks don't point outside working directory (CVE-2015-119)
	When creating symlinks from git-style patches, make sure the symlinks don't
	point above the current working directory.  Otherwise, a subsequent patch could
	use the symlink to write outside the working directory.

	* src/pch.c (symlink_target_is_valid): New function to check for valid symlink
	targets.
	* src/util.c (move_file): Use symlink_target_is_valid() here.
	* tests/symlinks: Add valid and invalid symlink test cases.

	Add line number overflow checking
	* bootstrap.conf: use intprops module.
	* src/common.h: Define LINENUM_MIN and LINENUM_MAX macros.
	* src/pch.c (another_hunk): Add line number overflow checking.  Based on Robert
	C. Seacord's INT32-C document for integer overflow checking and Tobias
	Stoeckmann's "integer overflows and oob memory access" patch for FreeBSD.

2014-11-30  Andreas Gruenbacher  <agruen@linbit.com>

	More savebuf/savestr error handling
	* bootstrap.conf: use xmemdup0 module.

	cannot recover from out-of-memory situations.
	(intuit_diff_type): Likewise, use xstrdup instead of savestr.
	(another_hunk): Handle the case when savestr returns NULL.
	* src/util.c (fetchname, parse_name): Use xmemdup0 instead of savebuf when we
	cannot recover from out-of-memory situations.

	Bugs pointed out by Tobias Stoeckmann <tobias@stoeckmann.org>.

2014-11-30  Tobias Stoeckmann  <tobias@stoeckmann.org>

	savebuf/savestr error handling
	* src/patch.c (get_some_switches): The function savebuf (and therefore savestr)
	copies strings using malloc.  If malloc fails, NULL is returned.  This is
	intentional behavior so that in case of failure during "plan a" patching, "plan
	b" can step in.  The return value has to be properly checked for NULL.  If the
	return value must not be NULL, use xstrdup instead.

2014-11-30  Andreas Gruenbacher  <andreas.gruenbacher@gmail.com>

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest
	* src/merge.c (compute_changes): The TOO_EXPENSIVE heuristic in diffseq has
	been removed, including compareseq's find_minimal parameter and the context's
	too_expensive limit.  Adjust.

2014-11-10  Jean Delvare  <jdelvare@suse.de>

	Drop useless test in another_hunk()
	src/pch.c (another_hunk): This test will always succeed.

2014-10-30  Tobias Stoeckmann  <tobias@stoeckmann.org>

	Buffer overflow on malicious input file
	There is a hard to reach but possible buffer overflow when using
	patch with a very large (modified) input file.  I doubt you will ever
	see this with a 64 bit system, but it's possible with 32 bit:

	$ echo hello > file1
	$ echo world > file2
	$ diff -Nau file1 file2 > file.diff

	Nothing fancy so far.  Adjust file1 so it contains at least one line that
	is 2 GB in size.  Larger is fine too, but stay below 4 GB.

	$ tr '\0' c < /dev/zero | dd bs=1K count=2097152 of=file1

	Now try to patch it.

	$ patch -Np0 -i file.diff
	Segmentation fault

	The issue is in patch's "plan b" strategy  (If your system would still
	want to use "plan a", force patch to use "plan b" through debug flag).

	Plan b writes lines into a temporary file, with equally long lines, so
	it can use a buffer mechanism to access them in a kind of randomly
	fassion.  In order to do that, it retrieves the longest line.

	In this example, it will encounter the 2 GB line and stores that as the
	longest one.  Afterwards it will adjust the tibufsize variable to be
	large enough:

	  for (tibufsize = TIBUFSIZE_MINIMUM;  tibufsize < maxlen;  tibufsize <<= 1)
	    /* do nothing */ ;

	Due to maxlen's size (2 GB), tibufsize will be SIZE_T_MAX, i.e. 4 GB.
	A few lines later it allocates space for the tibuf buffers:

	  tibuf[0] = xmalloc (2 * tibufsize);
	  tibuf[1] = tibuf[0] + tibufsize;

	This will allocate 0 bytes because tibufsize overflowed.  The next
	time patch writes into the buffer, a segmentation fault will occur...
	Depends on your system how long it takes until that happens. ;)

	The fix is simple:  Bail out on lines that are too long.  Patch already
	does that for files that have too many lines.

2013-05-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>  (tiny change)

	build: don't use -Werror in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
	Doing so prevents bootstrapping with bleeding-edge autotools,
	because of harmless deprecation warnings (that are not planned
	to become hard errors for at least a few years to come).  And
	unfortunately, options in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE take precedence over
	those given on the command line (this is a long-time wart of
	automake).

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Drop '-Werror' option.

	Update NEWS
	* NEWS: Update.

	Only warn when trying to modify read-only files
	Failing when trying to patch read-only files causes various users of patch to
	break.  Instead, warn by default and introduce a command line option for

	* patch.man: Describe the new behavior and command-line option.
	* src/patch.c (read_only_behavior): New variable.
	(main): Implement the new behavior.

	Fix "delete file which does not exist" test case
	* tests/create-delete: Remove left-over file f.orig before the test.

	For git-style patch files, do not output files immediately
	In git-style patch files, all patches refer to the initial state of the input
	files; files cannot be modified more than once.  Implement these semantics by
	creating all output files once all patches in the patch file have been
	processed.
	* src/patch.c (init_files_to_output, output_files): Add prototypes.
	(main): Remember which type of patch file we are processing.  Initialize the
	output files list.  Output files of git-style patches once all patches have
	been read, or when from git-style to normal patches.
	(file_to_output): New struct.
	(files_to_output): List of the files to output.
	(output_file, output_file_now, output_file_later): Either queue a file for
	deletion, remember to output a file later (git-style), or output the file
	immediately (normal).

	 forget_output_files): New functions.
	(gl_list_clear): Should be provided by gnulib but isn't.

	* tests/Makefile-am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove criss-cross; this test case works now.
	* tests/mixed-patch-types: Patch files that change from normal to git-style, or
	from git-style to normal.

	Export the patch type
	* src/pch.c (p_git_diff): New global variable.
	(intuit_diff_type): Use p_git_diff instead of a local variable.
	(pch_git_diff): New function.

	Remove invalid symlink test case
	* tests/symlinks: Remove test case which deletes and then recreates a symlink:
	all patches in a git-style input file must refer to the "before" state; the
	test case is invalid.

	No longer remember backup files
	Remembering backup files was needed because we would have lost track of deleted
	files before -- but we don't delete files immediately anymore.
	* src/util.c (create_backup_copy): No longer remember backup files.
	(create_backup): Likewise; update comment.
	(move_file): Update create_backup() call.
	* src/util.h (create_backup): Update prototype.

	* src/inp.c (plan_a): Don't leak "buffer" upon early return.

	emit one more diagnostic with the required "program_name: " prefix

	explicitly ignore close return value to placate static analyzers
