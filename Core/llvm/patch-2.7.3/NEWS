* When a file isn't being deleted because the file contents don't match the
  patch, the resulting message is now "Not deleting file ... as content
  differs from patch" instead of "File ... is not empty after patch; not
  deleting".
* Function names in hunks (from diff -p) are now preserved in reject files.
* With git-style patches, symlinks that point outside the working directory
  will no longer be created (CVE-2015-1196).

Changes in version 2.7.1:

* Two critical bug fixes in the "diff --git" format support.
* Clarify the message printed when a patch is expected to empty out and delete
  a file, but the file does not become empty.
* Various improvements to messages when applying a patch to a file of different
  type (regular file vs. symlink), when there are line ending differences (LF
  vs. CRLF), and when in --dry-run mode.
* When in the root directory, allow file names that are absolute or that
  contain a component of "..".
* New --follow-symlinks option to allow to treat symlinks as files: this was
  patch's behavior before version 2.7.
* Ignore when extended attributes cannot be preserved because they are
  unsupported or because permission to set them is denied.
* License clarifications in NEWS and README.
* Portability bug fixes.

Changes in version 2.7:

* Patch no longer gets a failed assertion for certain mangled patches.
* Ignore destination file names that are absolute or that contain a component
  of "..".  This addresses CVE-2010-4651.
* Support for most features of the "diff --git" format, including renames and
  copies, permission changes, and symlink diffs.  Binary diffs are not
  supported yet; patch will complain and skip them.
* Support for double-quoted filenames: when a filename starts with a double
  quote, it is interpreted as a C string literal.  The escape sequences \\, \",
  \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v, and \ooo (a three-digit octal number between 0
  and 255) are recognized.
* Refuse to apply a normal patch to a symlink.  (Previous versions of patch
  were replacing the symlink with a regular file.)
* When trying to modify a read-only file, warn about the potential problem
  by default.  The --read-only command line option allows to change this
  behavior.
* Files to be deleted are deleted once the entire input has been processed, not
  immediately.  This fixes a bug with numbered backup files.
* When a timestamp specifies a time zone, honor that instead of assuming the
  local time zone (--set-date) or Universal Coordinated Time (--set-utc).
* Support for nanosecond precision timestamps.
* Many portability and bug fixes.

Changes in version 2.6.1:

* Support for diff3(1) style merges which show the old, original, and new lines
  of a conflict has been added (--merge=diff3).  The default still is the
  merge(1) format (--merge or --merge=merge).
* Bug and portability fixes.

Changes in version 2.6:

* A regression test suite has been added ("make check").
* A --merge option has been added which will merge a patch file into
  the original files similar to merge(1).  See the patch(1) manual page for
  documentation.
* Unless a filename has been specified on the command line, look only
  for filenames in the patch until one has been found.  This prevents
  patch from tripping over garbage that isn't a patch.  When conforming
  to POSIX, this behavior is turned off and patch will ask for a
  filename if none is found.
* All reject files have file name headers, which allows them to be used as
  regular patches.
* When a patch file modifies the same file more than once, patch makes
  sure it backs up the original version of the file rather than any
  intermediary versions.
* In the above situation, if there are rejects in more than one of those
  patches, they all go into the same reject file.
* When the file to be patched is specified on the command line, all patches
  are applied to that file. (Previously, the first patch was applied to the
  file specified on the command line, and the names of additional files to
  patch were taken from header lines in the patch file.)
* The -r option now works correctly even if there are rejects in more than
  one file.  Use the - argument to discard rejects.
* Rejected hunks come out in unified diff format if the input patch was of
  that format, otherwise in ordinary context diff form.  Use the
  --reject-format option to enforce either "context" or "unified" format.
  Timestamps and the "diff -p" (--show-c-function) output are preserved.
  Changed lines in context format reject files are correctly indicated
  with '!' markers as the format defines.  Added and removed lines are
  still marked with '+' and '-', respectively.
* The file permissions of reject files are no longer set to match the files
  they modify.  Instead, they retain the default permissions.  This is
  consistent with reject files produced with the -r option.
* The --binary option disables the heuristic for stripping CRs from
  line endings in patches.  This allows to preserve CRs even in mangled
  patches, or in patches generated on non-POSIX systems and without the
  --binary option.
* Backup files for nonexisting files are now created with default
  permissions rather than with mode 0: backup files with mode 0 were
  causing problems with applications which do not expect unreadable
  files.
* The -B, -Y, and -z options (--prefix, --basename-prefix, --suffix) now
  imply the simple version control mode, and can be combined.
* Patch rejects more malformed normal format commands and checks for trailing
  garbage.  It now recognizes ed commands without addresses.
* Change the default value of PATCH_GET to 0.  (Previously, the default was 0
  under POSIXLY_CORRECT and negative otherwise; this is causing problems
  particularly with Perforce.)
* Handle missing timestamps better.
* Various bug fixes.
* Switch to GNU General Public License version 3.

Changes in versions 2.5.8 and 2.5.9: bug fixes only.

Changes in version 2.5.7:

* patch -D now outputs preprocessor lines without comments, as required
  by POSIX 1003.1-2001.

Changes in version 2.5.6:

* File names in context patches may now contain spaces, so long
  as the context patch headers use a tab to separate the file name
  from the time stamp.
* Perforce is now supported.
* Patch lines beginning with "#" are comments and are ignored.

Changes in version 2.5.5:

* The bug reporting address is now <bug-patch@gnu.org>.

Changes in version 2.5.4:

* A security hole has been closed.
  It involved race conditions with temporary files.

* The default quoting style is 'shell', which causes `patch' to quote
  file names with funny characters like `$'.  This prevents their
  misinterpretation if you cut them from its output and paste them into
  the shell.

* `patch' now works correctly with large files on Large File Summit
  hosts like Solaris 2.6.

* `patch' now ignores trailing carriage returns in lines of context diffs
  if the context diff headers end in carriage return.

* `patch' now ignores context diff header file names that have fewer slashes
   than the count specified by the -p or --strip option.

* New options:
  --posix
  --quoting-style=WORD

* New environment variables:
  QUOTING_STYLE

* `patch' now supports ClearCase version management.

Changes in version 2.5:

* Version control is now independent of whether backups are made.
  The -V or --version-control option and the VERSION_CONTROL and
  PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL environment variables no longer affect whether
  backups are made; they affect only the names of the backup files.

* When asking the user whether to reverse a patch,
  the default answer is now `no' instead of `yes'.

* `patch' can now recognize context diffs that have been encapsulated
  by prepending "- " to lines beginning with "-" (as per Internet RFC 934).

* `patch' now reports an error if the input contains garbage and no patches.

Changes in version 2.4:

* New options:
  -Z or --set-utc sets times of patched files, assuming diff uses UTC (GMT).
  -T or --set-time is similar, assuming local time (not recommended).
  --backup-if-mismatch makes a backup if the patch does not match exactly
  --no-backup-if-mismatch makes a backup only if otherwise requested

* The default is now --backup-if-mismatch unless POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.

* The -B or --prefix, -Y or --basename-prefix, and -z or --suffix options
  no longer affect whether backups are made (as they did in patch 2.2 and 2.3);
  they now merely specify the file names used when simple backups are made.

* When patching a nonexistent file and making backups, an empty backup file
  is now made (just as with traditional patch); but the backup file is
  unreadable, as a way of indicating that it represents a nonexistent file.

* `patch' now matches against empty and nonexistent files more generously.
  A patch against an empty file applies to a nonexistent file, and vice versa.

* -g or --get and PATCH_GET now have a numeric value that specifies
  whether `patch' is getting files.
  If the value is positive, working files are gotten from RCS or SCCS files;
  if zero, `patch' ignores RCS and SCCS and working files are not gotten;
  and if negative, `patch' asks the user whether to get each file.
  The default is normally negative, but it is zero if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.

* The -G or --no-get option introduced in GNU patch 2.3 has been removed;
  use -g0 instead.

* The method used to intuit names of files to be patched is changed again:
  `Index:' lines are normally ignored for context diffs,
  and RCS and SCCS files are normally looked for when files do not exist.
  The complete new method is described in the man page.

* By default, `patch' is now more verbose when patches do not match exactly.

* The manual page has a new COMPATIBILITY ISSUES section.

Changes in version 2.3:

* Unless the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set:

  - `patch' now distinguishes more accurately between empty and
    nonexistent files if the input is a context diff.
    A file is assumed to not exist if its context diff header
    suggests that it is empty, and if the header timestamp
    looks like it might be equivalent to 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
  - Files that ``become nonexistent'' after patching are now removed.
    When a file is removed, any empty ancestor directories are also removed.

* Files are now automatically gotten from RCS and SCCS
  if the -g or --get option is specified.
  (The -G or --no-get option, also introduced in 2.3, was withdrawn in 2.4.)

* If the PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL environment variable is set,
  it overrides the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.

* The method used to intuit names of files to be patched is changed.
  (It was further revised in 2.4; see above.)

* The new --binary option makes `patch' read and write files in binary mode.
  This option has no effect on POSIX-compliant hosts;
  it is useful only in on operating systems like DOS
  that distinguish between text and binary I/O.

* The environment variables TMP and TEMP are consulted for the name of
  the temporary directory if TMPDIR is not set.

* A port to MS-DOS and MS-Windows is available; see the `pc' directory.

* Backup file names are no longer ever computed by uppercasing characters,
  since this isn't portable to systems with case-insensitive file names.

Changes in version 2.2:

* Arbitrary limits removed (e.g. line length, file name length).

* On POSIX.1-compliant hosts, you can now patch binary files using the output
  of GNU `diff -a'.

* New options:
  --dry-run
  --help
  --verbose
  -i FILE or --input=FILE
  -Y PREF or --basename-prefix=PREF

* patch is now quieter by default; use --verbose for the old chatty behavior.

* Patch now complies better with POSIX.2 if your host complies with POSIX.1.

  Therefore:
  - By default, no backups are made.
    (But this was changed again in patch 2.4; see above.)
  - The simple backup file name for F defaults to F.orig
    regardless of whether the file system supports long file names,
    and F~ is used only if F.orig is too long for that particular file.
  - Similarly for the reject file names F.rej and F#.

  Also:
  - The pseudo-option `+' has been withdrawn.
  - -b is equivalent to --version-control=simple;
    `-z SUFF' has the meaning that `-b SUFF' used to.
  - Names of files to be patched are taken first from *** line and then from
    --- line of context diffs; then from Index: line; /dev/tty is
    consulted if none of the above files exist.  However, if the patch
    appears to create a file, the file does not have to exist: instead,
    the first name with the longest existing directory prefix is taken.
    (These rules were changed again in patch 2.3 and 2.4; see above.)
  - Exit status 0 means success, 1 means hunks were rejected, 2 means trouble.
  - `-l' ignores changes only in spaces and tabs, not in other white space.
  - If no `-p' option is given, `-pINFINITY' is assumed, instead of trying
    to guess the proper value.
  - `-p' now requires an operand; use `-p 0' to get the effect of the old plain
    `-p' option.
  - `-p' treats two or more adjacent slashes as if it were one slash.
  - The TERM signal is caught.
  - New option `-i F' reads patch from F instead of stdin.

* The `patch' options and build procedure conform to current GNU standards.
  For example, the `--version' option now outputs copyright information.

* When the patch is creating a file, but a nonempty file of that name already
  exists, `patch' now asks for confirmation before patching.

* RCS is used only if the version control method is `existing'
  and there is already an RCS file.  Similarly for SCCS.
  (But this was changed again in patch 2.3 and 2.4; see above.)

* Copyright notices have been clarified.  Every file in this version of `patch'
  can be distributed under the GNU General Public License.  See README for
  details.

Changes in version 2.1:

* A few more portability bugs have been fixed.  The version number has
  been changed from 2.0.12g11 to 2.1, because the name
  `patch-2.0.12g10' was too long for traditional Unix file systems.

Versions 2.0.12g9 through 2.0.12g11 fix various portability bugs.

Changes in version 2.0.12g8:

* Start of the 12g series, with a GNU-style configure script and
  long-named options.
* Added the -t --batch option, similar to -f.
* Improved detection of files that are locked under RCS or SCCS.
* Reinstate the -E option to remove output files that are empty after
  being patched.
* Print the system error message when system calls fail.
* Fixed various bugs and portability problems.
